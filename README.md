# Tw3lve
An iOS 12.0-12.1.2 Jailbreak
# What is Tw3lve?
Tw3lve is a Jailbreak originally written from Pwn20wnd's unc0ver code, at that time, it was only to fix unc0ver issues.
However, it has now been rewritten from the ground-up to be more stable and even better than unc0ver.
# Why should I choose this over unc0ver?
Tw3lve is meant to be a better unc0ver, succeeding in most areas, however failing in only two. Let's take a look at these changes and differences.
1. Tw3lve has a choice for Sileo/Substitute, Cydia/Substrate, Cydia/Substitite, or Sileo/Substrate. unc0ver doesnt.
2. Tw3lve is more stable than unc0ver, and is being rewritten to require less deb files. unc0ver has a fuckton of deb files.
3. Tw3lve was made with Substitute and Sileo in mind. unc0ver wasn't.
4. unc0ver has a more complex ViewController. Tw3lve has a more simple one.
